Tim previously managed Fox Welding—Fox Structures’ full-service, on-site weld shop. Identifying his career path early on, Tim’s high school work-study program led him to his first welding job over 25 years ago. Now his extensive experience—including work as a part-time farmer—has equipped him to be an instrumental member of the Fox Structures team on project sites, in the shop and across the table from customers. From project management and customer service to site supervision and fabrication, Tim approaches every job with careful detail and accuracy.
