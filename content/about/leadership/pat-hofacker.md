Pat is a front-facing, go-to resource for our clients, especially in the agriculture industry. Though he’s in the office most days, Pat’s no stranger to getting his hands dirty and understands the value of hard work. He’s spent most of his life working on his family’s farm, worked at Appleton Papers for over 30 years and even ran his own construction business for 20 years. Aside from being extremely capable, clients appreciate that Pat is honest, organized, cost conscious and focused on getting jobs done in a timely manner. As a leader for Fox Structures’ agricultural projects, Pat helps clients determine scope, budget, schedule and keeps the team on task. Outside the office, Pat enjoys time with family, coaching volleyball, cooking and personal construction projects.
