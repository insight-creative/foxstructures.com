If you’re looking to combine a workshop, oversized garage or other functional workspace into your home, a shouse is the perfect solution! These affordable steel buildings are not only functional but completely customizable to your style and taste.

Need some inspiration to start planning the design of your dream shouse? Take a look at the recent shouse construction projects the Fox Structures team has completed and see what’s possible with a custom shouse build in Northeast Wisconsin!

## A Classic Red Pole-Barn-Style Shouse
With a bold red exterior, barn-style windows and stone accents, this is one sharp looking shouse! The oversized concrete slab provides room for the covered porch, as well as the side patio, perfect for grilling and enjoying their sprawling view.

## A Wooded Cottage Shouse
[This secluded getaway cottage](/portfolio/brault-family-shouse-build/) is a shouse our team wrapped up on for Fox Structures team member Michelle and her husband Paul.

Unlike some of the other shouse projects we’ve completed in the past, this shouse has a unique cabin-like feel that instantly inspires relaxation.

The covered porch makes for the perfect grilling area as well as a spot to sit and take in the view. Its dark exterior blends well into the surrounding forest and gives this unique shouse the look of a log cabin without the high cost.

## A Modern Shouse with Oversized Garage
Finally, we have this steel shouse with a sleek, modern gray exterior and beautiful exposed wood beams wrapping around the porch.

We love how functional this large garage space is without taking away from the beautiful design of the living space.

## Interior Shouse Design
Wondering what it looks like on the inside of a shouse? The answer is, your shouse interior can be just about anything you’d like! If you can accomplish it in a typical home build, there’s almost no reason it can’t be done for your shouse.

For example, here is the interior of the wooded cottage shouse we showed above.

The open floor plan from kitchen to living room makes this smaller-sized shouse feel large and airy inside. Plus, the lightwood accents and stone fireplace keep the log cabin feeling with a modern upgrade.
