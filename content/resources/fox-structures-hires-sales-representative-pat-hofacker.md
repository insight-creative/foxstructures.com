Fox Structures recently hired Pat Hofacker as sales representative. With extensive farming and construction experience, Hofacker will specialize in leading agricultural and commercial projects from initial layout and design to finishing touches.

Hofacker worked for Appleton Papers for over 30 years, first as a millwright, then later as a master mechanic for the boiler house. He simultaneously ran a construction business—P&K Home Improvement, LLC—for 20 years. His career began with the completion of a Millwright apprenticeship from Fox Valley Technical College. Gaining agriculture experience early on, Hofacker worked on his family’s farm most of his life, even throughout his professional career.

In his new role, Hofacker will be responsible for sales and project management, offering valuable input every step of the way to ensure projects are done on time, within budget and meet the unique needs of each client.

Since 1982, Fox Structures has provided premier design and construction services throughout Northeast Wisconsin. Specializing in agricultural, commercial, retail, light manufacturing and residential buildings, Fox Structures also constructs mini warehouses, storage facilities and special-use buildings.
