When searching for a commercial builder, it’s important to think long-term. You don’t just need your building to look great—you need it to last! If you’re looking for high-quality commercial construction that stands the test of time, look no further.

With Fox Structures, your commercial construction investment will never go to waste. Our building design and construction professionals know what it takes to build exceptional, long-lasting commercial structures … and you don’t have to take our word for it.

We recently talked with Kurt Gruett, the operations director at Water-Right—one of Fox Structures’ many return clients—to follow up on a past commercial remodel project. Kurt shared how the building has held up, as well as follow-up upgrades that have been made since 2013.

## Water-Right’s Clean Water Center Remodel
[Water-Right](https://www.water-right.com/) is a Wisconsin-based Clean Water Center located in Appleton. They have relied on Fox Structures for all of their commercial construction needs since 2000.

> “Fox Structures has been our commercial building constructor since 2000. They built our main commercial center—a 40,000-square-foot combined office and warehouse—and have done all of the building upgrades and remodeling projects since.”
– Kurt Gruett

Our team has helped Water-Right in various capacities over the years through the following construction services:

### Commercial building design
With a combined commercial, office and warehouse space, Water-Right needed strategic design to make their office as efficient as possible.

Fox Structures’ expert commercial designers worked to create floor plans, layouts and overall building designs that were not only aesthetically pleasing, but also effective and efficient at meeting Water-Right’s complex needs.

### Commercial building repair
Life happens, and when it does, it can take a toll on commercial buildings. When Water-Right experienced a roof leak soon after their building remodel, they contacted Fox Structures.

The construction team was quickly onsite to find and repair the issue.

### Commercial remodel
When Water-Right needs commercial building expansions or redesigns, they turn to Fox Structures to create strategic remodel designs that meet and exceed their needs.

## Following up with Water-Right
We recently followed up with Kurt at Water-Right to learn how their water center is performing. The consensus? Fox structures’ high-quality construction stands the test of time.

> “Our building still looks and works great,” said Kurt. “The only issue we had after construction was a roof leak, which Fox Structures came and fixed immediately, at no cost to us.”

Plus, Kurt let us know our expert commercial designers make it easier than ever to upgrade or remodel Water-Right’s existing buildings. “They have been great at creating new floor plans and building designs that work for us and help us be as efficient as possible,” Kurt said.

### Would Water-Right work with Fox Structures again?
We value client feedback, and asked Kurt if, after many years in the same building and additional follow-up upgrades, he would continue to work with Fox Structures. Here’s what he had to say:

“You bet! We continue to use Fox Structures for building upgrades and remodels as our company grows—they always work great for what we need and have very fair pricing. We are very satisfied with their work and look forward to utilizing their commercial construction services in the future.”
