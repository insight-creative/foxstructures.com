When searching for an ag constructor to design and build your farm, equestrian facility or other ag property, it’s important to think long-term. Both for the longevity of your buildings and the ongoing partnership of your ag builder. That’s where we come in.

With Fox Structures, you’ll get ag buildings that stand the test of time, along with a team you can count on for all the renovations, additions and new builds you’ll need as you continue to grow.

You don’t have to take our word for it! Read on to hear about our decades-long partnership with Shiloh Dairy and learn why they’ve continued to work with Fox Structures for agricultural buildings since the inception of their farm.

## Ag Construction for Shiloh Dairy
Fox Structures has served as Shiloh Dairy’s main ag construction team for nearly two decades. We’ve helped the farm owners Gordon and Travis Speirs from the early inception of their farm to the present day.

> “We chose Fox Structures to build our dairy farm in 2003, back when it was nothing more than a field site. We were very happy with the work then, and we continue to be happy with their work nearly 20 years later.” – Gordon Speirs

Over the years, Fox Structures has provided the following agricultural construction services for the Brillion dairy farm:

### Farm design and building
Fox Structures worked closely with Gordon and Travis to design and build each of the functional, high-quality ag buildings for their farm.

### Ag buildouts and additions
Shiloh Dairy has grown since 2003, and our ag construction team has been there through every phase. As their farm has continued to grow, we’ve helped them build the necessary additions they need.

In fact, we currently have two projects in design for Shiloh Dairy to be implemented early next year.

### Ag building maintenance
Along with helping Shiloh Dairy grow, our ag construction team has helped to maintain the farm’s buildings. With yearly maintenance of the facility’s concrete and buildings, Gordon and Travis are able to ensure their animals, supplies and farm overall are always in the best conditions.

## Shiloh Dairy’s Trusted Farm Builder
We pride ourselves on the ongoing partnership we have with Shiloh Dairy so they can keep up their great work in Brillion.

> “20 years later and we are still building with Fox and continue to work with them for yearly building maintenance. They are always great to work with and we appreciate their upfront communication that keeps things running efficiently. We’ll continue to build with Fox and recommend them to anyone seeking a reliable ag construction partner in Wisconsin.” – Gordon Speirs
