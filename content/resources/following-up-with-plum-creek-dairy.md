## Plum Creek Dairy’s Expansion

When seeking an agricultural contractor for your farm, you want one who will get the job done despite what’s happening in the world. Here at Fox Structures, we know that farmers need to keep going no matter what, and so do we. When Plum Creek Dairy in Waupun, Wisconsin, approached us during the pandemic with the need for three new structures for their growing operation, we didn’t let labor and supply shortages slow us down.  

The Fox Structures construction team immediately started to build the structures, which included calf, transition and heifer barns. The team worked over the winter from November 2020 to February 2021 in order to complete the project in time for the spring season 2021. 

We recently talked with Plum Creek Dairy owner Abe Lemmenes who shared how working with Fox Structures kept the dairy’s operation growing.

## Calf Barn 

Fox Structures built a 44’ x 360’ calf barn for Plum Creek Dairy. The barn included finished offices, heated storage, a heated wet calf area and about 160 stalls. 

## Transition Barn 

Plum Creek Dairy also needed a transition barn, and the Fox Structures crew built the 45’ x 380’ six-row, steel-column barn with Microllam® rafters. The building includes approximately 260 stalls. 

## Heifer Barn 

Plum Creek also required a freestall barn to house its heifers, and Fox Structures completed a 116’ x 196’ steel frame structure with a solar front exterior. “We wanted to bring our heifers home so we raise them ourselves,” Abe said. 

## Following up with Abe from Plum Creek 

We followed up with Abe to see how the barn buildings have been holding up, and about his satisfaction with the ongoing service Fox Structures has provided. Here’s what he had to say: 

> “We’ve had Fox Structures do some more projects for us since then. They’re top notch, and they’re on top of their stuff—they’re timely and get things done like they say they’re going to do. We’ve had a couple of things where it’s been pretty time-sensitive, and they’ve made it happen. They’re a good group of guys.” — Abe 

When asked if he would recommend Fox Structures to other ag owners in the area, Abe said, “I would. The Fox Structures team has great follow-through.”
