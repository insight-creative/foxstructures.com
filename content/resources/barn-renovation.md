## Ag building renovation 101

*What exactly is a barn renovation*? A barn or ag building renovation is typically a large-scale project that updates or modifies an existing structure or building on your farm.

### Barn renovation vs. barn repair

While every ag project is unique, renovations typically tend to be much larger and more complex projects than barn repairs.

Usually, barn repairs only address one or two concerns in an ag building, like faulty electrical wiring or a leaking roof. Barn renovations, on the other hand, can encompass design and layout changes, interior and exterior reconfigurations and additions to the entire structure.

### 1\. Your barn has been out of use for multiple years.

Whether you just purchased farm property with an old barn structure or you have an old barn sitting around on your property, it’s likely not in the best shape.

Most older, unmaintained barns have rotting wood, rodent infestations and other barriers that will keep you from being able to use your building.

A complete barn renovation can help you restore your old barn to its former glory and get the most out of each building on your farm.

### 2\. Your barn has mold, termites or other infestation.

Once an infestation has taken over your barn or other ag building, there isn’t much to be done but to remove and replace the affected area(s).

If you notice mold, signs of termites, extreme water damage or other kinds of major building issues or infestation, it’s time to renovate.

### 3\. Your barn isn’t big enough.

You can’t do business and keep your farm operational with a barn that’s too small. If you’ve outgrown your space but still love the overall design, a barn renovation is the perfect solution.

This way, you can add more space to your barn without having to invest in an entirely new building.

### 4\. Your barn has outdated technology.

Environ-Tech, Agrimesh AI and various other farming technologies are essential to [automate your farming operations](/resources/farming-technology-automating-agricultural-buildings/) and keep up with the competition. If your barn isn’t outfitted with the latest technology, it’s likely time for an upgrade.

Since most high-tech farming equipment needs to be fully integrated within your barn, they can be difficult to add to existing buildings without expert help. Our ag team has helped prep barns for seamless installation and integration of various farm technologies.

### 5\. Your barn no longer works for you.

Even the most beautiful barn is completely useless if it doesn’t work for you. If your barn’s layout, construction or overall design simply doesn’t fit your current farm operation, a barn renovation can help bring value back to your barn.

Whether you need some interior walls taken down and reconstructed elsewhere, a different layout for animal stalls or something else entirely, our team can help design and construct your ideal barn.
