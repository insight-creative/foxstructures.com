    “They’re just good, down-to-earth people, and they get things done. They move fast when they need to, and I think that’s what I like the most—seeing progress and seeing things get done when they need to get done. We’re just very thankful for everything Fox Structures has done for us, and we’re obviously looking forward to continuing to build more.”

When Underdog Storage wanted to expand their growing business, owners Neil Schiesl and Jason Metz turned to Fox Structures to help them add new buildings at two locations. 

Underdog first enlisted Fox Structures to help with new storage buildings on Clairemont Drive in Appleton off of Highway 15, working the entire project from site plan to engineering to final build.  

“Fox Structures has a good name and reputation,” Neil said. “We talked to some people around the area, and Fox Structures was the most up front and the most willing to work with us at that time.” 

During winter 2024, crews at Fox Structures were completing the seventh, eighth and ninth buildings at that location. 

The Fox Structures team also completed several storage unit buildings for Underdog Storage on Miners Way in De Pere—in a very timely fashion—with Underdog purchasing the property in December 2023 and the buildings up by March 2024. “It was really impressive how quickly that project moved, and it really helped us out,” Neil said. 

Underdog added some outlets in some of the units that are geared toward storage of boats and ATVs/UTVs so renters can trickle charge their batteries, Neil said. The large 13-by-45-foot units have outlets and lights in each. 

Underdog Storage also wanted a gate at the De Pere facility, which required some extra conduit, wiring, a keypad and mount. 

“I just let Fox Structures know what we wanted and they just took care of it,” Neil said. “Sometimes some companies will make a hassle of that stuff, where this was very seamless as they knew what we’re doing and the why, so it was pretty easy.”
