After enlisting Fox Structures to build multiple agriculture buildings on their dairy farm, the McCarthys knew they had the creativity and skill for this unique project. In just one short month, the Fox Structures crew erected a new building fit for fitness! The single-story, one-room structure is the perfect size and space for their growing cross-training business. Outfitted with two large oversized doors, equipment can easily be transported in and out; plus there’s an option for plenty of air flow on nice days. At the center of the structure, a steel i-beam was custom-fabricated to bear the weight of an assortment of hanging gymnastics equipment.
