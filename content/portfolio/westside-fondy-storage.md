When Kurt from Westside Fondy Storage wanted to expand their business and create additional storage units, he reached out to Fox Structures to get the job done right. Within just two months, Fox Structures built two new warehouses totaling an additional 54 storage units for the business. Through strong rapport and constant communication, Kurt stayed informed throughout the entire process and the team was able to remedy any issues that arose to ensure the build was properly completed on time. With the additional storage units Fox Structures created, Westside Fondy Storage has been able to successfully rent out more space, boost sales and grow their business.
