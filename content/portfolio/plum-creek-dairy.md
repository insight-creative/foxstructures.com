    “Everything Fox Structures did was top-notch. There were no complaints from anyone. The foreman, Brad, was really good. He was flexible during the building process and a great communicator. Because of COVID-19, material prices went up, but Fox Structures honored the prices they committed to up front. The Fox Structures team worked great with our concrete team and were accommodating to their needs. I would recommend Fox Structures to others.”

When Plum Creek Dairy needed three new structures to accommodate their growing farm, they relied on Fox Structures and their longstanding reputation as agriculture specialists. Even with labor and supply shortages associated with the pandemic, Fox Structures was able to begin building the calf, transition and heifer barns immediately. The crews worked over the winter, from November to February, to have the buildings ready by spring.
