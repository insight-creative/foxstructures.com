    “Fox Structures was recommended to us by another firm. From day one, they were very professional. I have no complaints at all on their workmanship or the quality of individuals on their team. I could communicate very easily with them throughout the project. I didn’t always have to go through the project manager to get things done on site. I was involved heavily there every day,  and all the guys were easy to work with and were great at making it happen. I would absolutely recommend Fox Structures. They were responsive, knowledgeable and did great work!”

When C3 Corporation’s employee and machinery needs began to exceed their 88,000-square-foot, single-story building, they turned to Fox Structures for a large-scale demolition and renovation. With an increased need for floorspace, Fox Structures built a second-story mezzanine overlooking the manufacturing floor. This multi-functional space includes new offices, conference rooms and tradeshow display areas. The fully remodeled main floor includes new employee offices, restrooms and break areas, plus shipping and receiving, conference rooms and a refurbished entrance. Though there were inspection and material delays due to COVID-19, Fox Structures completed this renovation in just nine months without incident.
