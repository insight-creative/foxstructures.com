When American Family Insurance Agent Leah Burg approached Fox Structures about building a new office, our team listened carefully. Leah had a vision for a quaint, yet versatile and professional, space to meet with clients and house her small business. The crew at Fox Structures brought Leah’s vision to life with a design that was a true collaboration between builder and customer. The space includes a kitchen, two bathrooms, utility and storage rooms, two private offices, and an open lobby with vaulted ceilings. A charming, covered porch with cedar columns and stone wainscoting provides a warm welcome that makes customers feel right at home. With quality, long-lasting materials, this building will maintain the sharp professionalism of American Family Insurance for many years to come.
