As a Fox Structures employee, Michelle knew she could count on Fox Structures’ expert construction team to build the residence and workshop she and her husband Paul had been dreaming about. Fox Structures worked with the Braults to custom design the perfect layout—complete with a heated workshop—and build their dream shouse in just eight months! Now, the Braults have a beautiful cottage surrounded by woods, as well as a functional garage and workshop space, all within the same building!
