After years of working with Fox Structures to build a substantial lot of storage units, Appleton Northeast Storage called upon our crews again to expand their business with two additional mini warehouses. In just a few months, Fox Structures erected side-by-side storage units complete with a variety of room sizes (ranging 10×15-10×30), sectional doors and even a spacious office! For extra flexibility, Fox Structures designed and built an additional wall partition allowing the owners to divide and adjust storage unit sizes. Snow stoppers were also added to the roof to prevent rapid snow melt in spring.
