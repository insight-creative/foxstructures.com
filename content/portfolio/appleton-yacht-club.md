    “Start to finish, Fox Structures did a great job, identified and solved issues and communicated them thoroughly to our team. Fox Structures ran into issues with the underlying infrastructure on the project and came up with cost-effective solutions we were happy with. We liked the concept of repair/replacement. They were straightforward, fair, no surprises. They also met the agreed-upon cost. Pricing was competitive. I would highly recommend the organization.”

When the Appleton Yacht Club needed to replace their over 50-year-old roof structures covering numerous boat slips, they called upon the repair/replacement experts at Fox Structures. The project was particularly challenging as the work took place over the Fox River in the winter months from January to April. Weather, ice and water were all factors. Adhering to strict DNR compliance standards, the Fox Structures crew worked over the water to not only replace the existing rubber roof system but make it more attractive as well. The roof—once compiled of staggered heights—was straightened, plus front and side facades were added for a cleaner appearance.
