    “We have been working with Fox Structures for many years, as they built all of the structures on our farm, and they always impress with their professionalism and expertise. With this particular rebuild, I was amazed by how quickly they were able to work. Mark from Fox Structures had sourced all the necessary materials just days after our structure fire, and the team had our storage shed rebuilt and operational in just 20 days. I would definitely recommend Fox Structures to any farms or other businesses in the area.”

When See Farms experienced a structural fire on their livestock farm, they were left without a hay storage shed in the middle of the busy baling season. Fox Structures worked quickly to complete the rebuild of the essential storage shed in just 20 days, all while helping to keep the farm operational during the build. See Farms was even able to use the structure to store hay before the building was completely finalized, ensuring no time was wasted.
