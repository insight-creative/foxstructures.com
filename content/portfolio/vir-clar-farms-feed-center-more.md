    “Fox Structures has been our builder since 1995. After we expanded in 2015, we realized we’d outgrown our feed center. So, we spent a lot of time with them, discussing workflow, traffic planning and other details. They understood our vision and got it down on paper. Fox Structures is great from a design standpoint. They’re not the biggest company, but I don’t think you have to be big to meet our objectives if you’re dedicated to providing great service. All other things aside, people buy from people—and this is about the relationship between Vir-Clar and Fox Structures. I believe Fox Structures just has great people. I absolutely recommend them to other dairies!”

Since 1995, Vir-Clar Farms has trusted Fox Structures to help build their thriving, family owned dairy in Fond du Lac. As Vir-Clar has grown, they’ve turned to Fox Structures for a steel frame freestall barn, heifer barn and other buildings. Most recently, Vir-Clar again looked to Fox Structures to design, fabricate and build a unique, partially enclosed, 24,000-square-foot feed center. The center efficiently handles corn deliveries, provides covered bays for feed storage and houses the 200-hp mixer that produces 180 tons of feed daily to satisfy their 2,000 cows.
