After a great building experience with Fox Structures on the Cherryland’s Best remodel, the owner of Black Diamond—a storage and leasing company—knew they would be perfect for this new build. In just two short months, the Fox Structures crew constructed modern storage units with traditional entrances, large overhead doors and even full bathrooms.
