When the owner of Hansen Septic needed a larger workshop to accommodate their growing business, Fox Structures helped to demolish the old one and rebuild a larger, more functional structure in its place. To save costs, the Fox Structures team creatively incorporated the existing foundation into the new building design. Now the unique L-shape layout provides two workshops in one, plus plenty of room for growth!
