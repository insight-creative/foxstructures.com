    “As our company changed, we realized we needed to remodel. There’s a comfort level working with Fox Structures, because they know what they’re doing, and they simplify the building process so you don’t need to sweat every detail. The biggest challenge was that our daily operations were going on throughout the remodel. Fox Structures had to reroute the plumbing and computer lines and it had to be done in stages so it didn’t impede workflow. They also needed to bring in some “big steel” and move it around our showroom after hours, without breaking anything. They did a great job! All of the guys were good to work with and if you had questions they took time to answer. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Fox Structures.”

Water-Right’s Clean Water Center has conducted residential and commercial water testing, and provided clean water solutions, since 2003. Over the years, they’ve turned to Fox Structures for their building needs. When their main facility—built in 2010—needed a big remodel, they called Fox Structures once again. Fox Structures gutted most of the building, added a second story, renovated the showroom, added on to the state-certified lab, opened up the work area and added 15 office, sales and lab work stations. In addition to more space and better workflow, the structure’s impressive open steel framing and glass give it a real WOW factor!
