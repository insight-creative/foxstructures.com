    “Every employee seems to really know what is going on. They all do a good job. When it’s done, I know it’ll be done right. I don’t have to do any callbacks or when I do, I know it’ll be taken care of. I can’t say it enough … anyone you talk to there—whether it’s the office staff or crew members on the job site—everyone is very personable and nice to deal with, accommodating and decent. They make building easy and are always watching out for us. Not only would I recommend them, but I have recommended them. The biggest compliment I can give is to recommend them to others.”

After a long history working with Fox Structures, there was never a question of who would build Cecil and Green Bay Storage Center’s newest units. Owner Joseph Murphy saw Fox Structures’ quality work and dedicated service firsthand when they built a large shed and office for his construction company in Freedom. Now, five years later, Fox Structures has built nine additional storage units between Cecil, Hortonville, Green Bay, and Readfield to accommodate his company’s rapid growth. While the storage units may be standard steel structures, the service was anything but average Murphy shared. The Fox Structures crew was described as “flexible, personable and easy to work with!”
