Speedy Clean is a sewer cleaning and inspection company serving residential, commercial, agricultural, municipal and industrial customers in Northeast Wisconsin. As Speedy Clean’s business services grew, so did their workspace needs. Over four years, they relied on Fox Structures for multiple expansion projects including two new buildings, an addition and an extensive remodel with a second-floor addition. During all of these projects, Fox Structures not only worked around a fully operational business but also kept the total square footage just under what’s required for a complete sprinkler system while maximizing the space.
