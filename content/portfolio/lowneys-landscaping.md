For years, Lowney's Landscaping has worked with [Fox Structures](/) to support its growing landscape services with buildings to house its equipment. So when it was time to add on to a [storage building](/construction-services/storage/) that had been finished in 2017, Lowney's again turned to Fox Structures to help them expand. 

“We basically took the square footage we had in 2017 and doubled it,” said Owner Joe Lowney. “We expanded and bought Jason’s Tree Service a few years back, so we just needed a place for their equipment and a little more room for our mechanics.” 

The expansion matched the original building and included 24-foot-wide doors to fit two crews per door. “They’re definitely tall enough to get our equipment in,” Lowney said. “And the whole building is insulated and heated, letting us keep our equipment out of the elements.” 

The new addition, which added about 12,000 square feet to the building, was finished in 2024. 

Also, when a strong storm hit in 2022, two of the Lowney's buildings sustained significant hail damage. The Fox Structures team helped put new roofs on both buildings and added new steel to one of them. “And we insulated that one and used the steel from the outside of the building and put that on the inside, so it looks nice and finished on the outside of it,” Lowney said. 

That project was completed in spring 2023. 

“It was good working with Fox Structures again,” Lowney said. “We have a good relationship with them—they’re easy to work with. They’re always available to answer the questions we have and work on projects when we need them.”
