When global packaging supply company, Amcor, was overdue for an overhaul on their RE&D Campus building, they turned to Fox Structures because of their strong reputation for commercial building. The existing concrete block facility, built in the 1980s, was showing signs of mortar joint decay prompting concern about its structural integrity. Despite Mother Nature’s challenges, Fox Structures worked through the winter months to restore the building with new steel siding. The steel exterior gave the building an incredible facelift for a fraction of the cost of replacing concrete block! Simple exterior upgrades—such as two-toned colors to match the renowned Amcor brand and new exterior LED lights—took this restoration project to the next level!
