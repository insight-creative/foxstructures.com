Fox Structures collaborated with the owner of Forest Brook Farms to design two unique multi-purpose buildings for their farm in Chilton. The first includes a shop, storage room and a sizable wash bay with capacity for multiple semis or large farm equipment, plus a service pit. The second features an employee lounge, work out area and office that can convert to living space.
