When Cherryland’s Best needed to remodel their massive production and storage facility, they knew Fox Structures could provide the customization needed. As a wholesale producer of Door County’s famous fruit, Cherryland’s Best stores, prepares and packages massive amounts of product on site, so moisture control, drainage, insulation and temperature control were crucial. In just three months, the Fox Structures team erected a beautiful and functional storage facility complete with a cooler, freezer—with high speed doors—and a specially insulated floor.
