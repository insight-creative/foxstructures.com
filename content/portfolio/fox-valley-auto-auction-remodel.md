If you’ve ever driven on HWY 41 heading towards Green Bay, you’ve no doubt seen Fox Valley Auto Auction, located just off the highway in De Pere, WI. In such a high-visibility area, the business owner Mark knew it was time to improve the look of his commercial building but didn’t want to commit to a complete rebuild. Fox Structures helped determine which upgrades would make the biggest impact within his budget and helped to give the building a much-needed remodel.

The commercial construction team completed various metal building alterations,  modernized the exterior and gave the entire commercial building the upgrade it needed.
