When Jerry Verstegen sought to build multi-use commercial storage space, he leaned on Fox Structures’ solid expertise. Jerry’s custom high-end storage facility includes three units with shop space, restrooms, large-scale overhead doors and an industrial steel exterior. Throughout the building process, the crew’s workmanship matched the high quality of the building itself. When unexpected delays hindered the installation of gas and electricity, Fox Structures provided backup supplies and equipment to get tenants in on time. In the end, Jerry was pleased with the outcome, stating, “The design and workmanship shows in the appearance of the building. It looks professional and well built.”
