When Geff Galbari and his wife, Kimberly Galuska, who are both pilots and airline mechanics, wanted their own airplane hanger, Fox Structures took up the challenge right away. 

“I think within a week Fox Structures had preliminary preview drawings of the building, with the colors we wanted and details like that,” Geff said. “They were very receptive and very professional.” 

Geff and Kimberly wanted a structure that could accommodate their small aircraft and tractors they use for maintaining their property—a farm that has been in Kimberly’s family for five generations. They also wanted it to include space for working on their equipment. “The biggest feature we wanted was a heated shop, and we wanted a heated floor, being in Wisconsin.” 

They also needed a special wide door to accommodate their aircraft. Fox Structures installed a 40’ x 16’ bi-fold door made by premier manufacturer Schweiss Doors of Minnesota. “Everyone who sees it is fascinated by it,” said Geff, who has been flying since 1978 and owns a vintage Taylorcraft. 

Galbari and Galuska eventually plan to upgrade to a wider tractor door and hope to install an airstrip on their property. The hangar/shop was completed in April 2024.  

“It’s what we always wanted—it’s what our parents would have dreamed of having, and we finally got it done,” Geff said.
