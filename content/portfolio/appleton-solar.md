    “Building a building is never easy, no matter how smoothly you think it might go, but Fox Structures made the process as painless as it could be. Everyone was very personable to work with, from the owner all the way to the people who are actually putting it all together. If we had questions on-site, there was always someone willing to speak with us. They understood and incorporated our vision—we love our building.”

Since 2008, entrepreneurs Ingrid and Patrick Nahm had been operating their solar panel business out of their home, using multiple storage units to house their equipment, materials, tools and supplies. 

When the market shifted in the right direction, it was time to consolidate Appleton Solar into one location. “We wanted to make things a little easier and to be more effective in our work,” Ingrid said. “It was nice to get everything into one central location.” 

So the Nahms turned to the team at Fox Structures to help them complete a comprehensive storage building which would not only support their growing renewable energy venture, but also include a welcoming and sustainable space for their team. 

“We wanted to have enough natural light to come in the shop area,” Ingrid said. “And we wanted to have larger doors to accommodate our equipment.” The Nahms also wanted to incorporate a climate-controlled office, breakroom and small conference area. 

“We wanted to make an energy-efficient building that was well-suited for low-energy use,” Ingrid said. “In addition to that, we wanted it to blend in nicely with the surrounding area.” Fox Structures oriented the building on the five-acre property to accommodate a retention pond and to leave space for a solar array that provides the building’s electricity.  

The project was completed in November 2023.
