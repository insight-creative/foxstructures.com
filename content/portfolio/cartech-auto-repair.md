    “Our previous builder wouldn’t even talk to me without a down payment first. Fox Structures came up with a plan before I even made a commitment. The crew was also great. They kept everything neat, clean and orderly, so we could continue to conduct business while they were working. Overall, Fox Structures was easy to work with. Throughout the process, they weren’t adding stuff on and jacking up the price. Materials were ordered on time. The vaulted ceiling was a huge undertaking, and they did a really good job with designing that. There were no challenges. It was seamless. I absolutely would recommend Fox Structures to others. I already have several times!”

As a modern automotive shop committed to quality, CarTech wanted to remodel their existing space to better reflect their brand. In just three months, Fox Structures helped CarTech rev up their customer experience with a showstopping remodel featuring a new exterior, entry and waiting room with many amenities … spacious bathrooms, convenient kitchen area, kids’ playroom and gorgeous showroom. Modern details—such as tempered glass room partitions, all-brick exterior, floor-to-ceiling ceramic bathroom tile and a vaulted skylight—elevated the entire project.
