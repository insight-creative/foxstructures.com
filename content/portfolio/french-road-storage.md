    “I would recommend Fox Structures 100 percent. They’re good communicators—they tell us when they’re coming, when the work’s going to be done, and it’s really easy to change anything along the way. They’re very patient, have great attention to detail, and they do great work.”

With a growing waitlist for larger storage units, French Road Storage owners wanted to grow their capacity with modular units that could accommodate their customers’ needs. With Fox Structures having completed another storage unit project ([Appleton Northeast Storage](/portfolio/appleton-northeast-storage/)), co-owner Cory Coenen knew the team could help them with their industrial building needs. 

Coenen and his partners wanted to establish some modular units that could be expanded for customers who needed lots of space for their RVs, boats or extra stuff. 

Three buildings were completed in fall 2024, with most units already occupied by the end of 2024. Four more buildings will be completed in spring 2025. And in total, the project could have up to 18 buildings containing between 330 and 475 units, Cory said. 

Unit sizes start at 11 x 20 to 15 x 45, with the ability to expand up to 45 x 90. “We have ‘deluxe units,’ where if you rented the standard 15 x 45, you could go open it up to 30 x 45 without the interior wall,” Cory said.  

The owners say it’s great to have more capacity to rent large units out to people who are seeking the storage space. 

“Building these units with trusses really gives us the flexibility to cover anybody who needs that bigger space,” Cory explained. “We focused on large units because we’ve had a waitlist over here at our current place. The demand was here.”
