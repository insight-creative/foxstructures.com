    “It was our first time working with Fox Structures, and they were the right choice, not only for price but their quality and professionalism as well. First and foremost, communication is most important, and they excelled at that, from design to finish, especially on the day-to-day build and coordinating subcontractors. They had a lot of attention to detail. Anytime you build on an existing operational dairy, it’s chaotic. They were good at staying efficient so we could stay efficient. They also had ideas to cut cost while maintaining quality and integrity, which was especially helpful with cost of materials right now. I would absolutely recommend Fox Structures to others.”

Spring Breeze Dairy’s multiple locations are home to 3,400 cows producing over 32,000 gallons of milk per day. When they needed to expand facilities at their location near Antigo, Spring Breeze Dairy also needed an agricultural builder with experience. Fox Structures helped to build a new free-stall barn—complete with an innovative maternity wing—plus demolish and rebuild a neighboring barn as an addition to the birth-centric floorplan. Enhancements, such as bonus calf stalls and brighter overhead lighting brought this project to the next level. Overall, the new floor plan—specially designed for the flow of heifer laboring, birthing and recovery—resulted in a more efficient, comfortable and safe environment for the dairy’s herd and workers.
