    “Fox Structures’ performance is above excellent. The crew was polite and courteous when I had a question or minor change to the building plan. Our property was always clean at the end of the day, and there was never garbage or excess materials lying around. The communication throughout the project was second-to-none. I would absolutely recommend Fox Structures to anyone. From start to finish, our project went very smoothly.”

When Freedom-based start-up Two Guernsey Girls Creamery needed a reliable and experienced commercial-agriculture builder for their small-scale creamery, Fox Structures responded with enthusiasm. “Fox Structures had the best timeframe to build, as well as the best price,” owner Tammy Fritsch shared. That enthusiasm was equally matched with the crew’s expertise as they helped the creamery interpret and comply with the state’s strict building guidance for dairy operations. The new structure features two fully equipped dairy processing rooms with viewing windows, a store front and office area.
