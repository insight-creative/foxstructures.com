Since starting its business in 1999, Skid Steers has moved multiple times to accommodate growth in their company, always fitting its company into available commercial space. But when the company continued to grow, it soon became clear that building its own new facility made the most sense.  

That’s when Skid Steers chose Fox Structures as their partner for the project.  

“We had contacted a few different companies, and the care and responsiveness that we got from the staff at Fox Structures made us feel the most at ease,” says owner Joy Janssen. “Our meeting with them gave us the best sense that we’d be taken care of, and that our needs were going to be fully understood, considered and taken care of.” 

Skid Steers needed a space large enough to accommodate its inventory of heavy equipment and attachments, as well as a new office space and an easy access loading dock. The company also wanted water sources available for restrooms and a shower. 

“We wanted things laid out so that we could separate certain things if we wanted, and we wanted certain things available to us in the office space,” Joy said. “We didn’t want anything outlandish, but in some ways, we didn’t really know what we wanted.”  

But the Fox Structures team was able to anticipate what questions the Skid Steers team would have and point out the pros and cons of certain features for the new building. 

“They were incredibly responsive,” Joy says. “We’ve never done this before, and they were able to answer questions in a way that you never felt like you were being a dummy for asking. They were happy to help us, they were good with explaining when we didn’t understand. That made the experience great for us.”
