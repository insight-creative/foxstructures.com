    “When we first met with Mike and Alex, we felt like they were open and up to the challenge of creating a space with a 'wow' factor! If we had a question about anything at all, Fox Structures was awesome at explaining why/how things on the project could be done. If we needed something changed, they were accommodating. The whole crew was completely amazing—down to earth and hardworking. We would absolutely recommend Fox Structures. Their attention to detail and flexibility on design was on point.”

Fox Structures helped bring to life the whimsical vision for Hidden Hollow ART’s retail space, or as they call it, “Inspiration Destination.” As a hand-crafted metal/wood art shop, the stand-alone building reflects the company’s eclectic character with a unique combination of materials. Standout features include a gorgeous corrugated steel, standing seam roof and the artist’s custom-made rusty steel shingle pieces. A beautiful I-beam loft served as a perfect canvas for the artists to add their own colorful railings.
