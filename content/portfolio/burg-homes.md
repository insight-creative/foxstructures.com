    “Working with Fox Structures was a great experience overall—we’re very pleased with the whole building and the finished product. We’re in the business of building custom high-end houses for clients as well, so we’re very understanding if an issue arises, knowing we need to work through it together. Fox Structures was good at doing so as well.”

High-end home builder Burg Homes had been operating out of a shared space with another business. When that business was ready to expand its operations, Burg Homes decided it was time for them to build their own headquarters across the road. 

“It was a good fit for both of us to jump at that time,” said Jordan Weed, one of Burg Homes’ four owners. “We expanded and built new to allow ourselves to grow and have the space to do so.” 

Burg Homes wanted a building that could contain an attractive office space as well as a shop area and storage space for their business. 

“We wanted something different,” Jordan said. “We weren’t looking for a traditional wood frame building, so we did the steel, and it fit our needs across the board.” 

The company was directed to Fox Structures through a referral from a client, and when the Fox Structures team came back with a design, “they nailed it—they ‘wow’ed us enough to say ‘go,’” Jordan said.  

The Burg Homes team sought a large conference space with attractive, southwest-facing windows that allowed for natural lighting. “Fox Structures figured out how to best situate the building on the site to utilize the windows, and it’s worked out well for us,” Jordan said. “We get a lot of compliments on the building.” 

The Burg Homes team moved into the building Memorial Day weekend 2023.
