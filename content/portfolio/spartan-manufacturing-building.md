    “It was really good working with Fox Structures. I got to interface a lot with the subcontractors that they hired. They did a good job, they helped with the process going through the village of Little Chute. They also helped address all the tenant’s concerns, and that was great.”

When FinishMaster, an aftermarket auto parts distributor, needed a special building for its Fox Valley location to manufacture its automotive and industrial paints, owner TJ Lamers turned to Fox Structures commercial construction team to meet all the necessary specifications and local requirements for the structure. 

“It has an explosion-proof paint area with special lights and special fans,” TJ Lamers said. “We basically needed to build a building-within-a-building to protect the area from explosion.” 

The Fox Structures crew worked with Lamers, FinishMaster and the village of Little Chute throughout the process of constructing the brand-new 70’ x 144’ build-to-suit manufacturing facility to meet the company’s needs. During the project, Fox Structures ensured the structure had all the required features for safety, as well as building out a 60’ x 25’ office area with features like a conference room and private office.  

“It was a challenging project between keeping the village happy, the state inspectors happy, the tenants happy and me happy,” TJ Lamers said. “It’s not an easy job.” 

Thanks to Fox Structures, FinishMaster was able to move into the new manufacturing facility with the peace of mind that it was meeting all needed safety requirements.
