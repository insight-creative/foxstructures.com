    “Once the concrete was poured, the building really went up quick. When we had ideas to make use of extra space for closets or offices, Fox Structures jumped right on the changes and got it taken care of. They were flexible! Mike Klarner was knowledgeable, timely and professional, and the crews were all very professional. They always got back to me quickly if I had any questions. I sure would recommend Fox Structures and I have!”

As enrollment continued to rise at Valley Christian School of Oshkosh, they began exploring expansion options for middle school classrooms. When they realized that building a new permanent structure would be more affordable than temporary rented classrooms, the school reached out to Fox Structures. Knowing the school wanted to eventually use the space as a bus garage, Fox Structures developed a custom plan for a spacious new middle school wing including six classrooms, two bathrooms and a study area. With special high-quality garage flooring, this durable building is equipped to withstand the activity of kids today and possibly vehicles in the future.
