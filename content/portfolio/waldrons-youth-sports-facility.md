    “We chose Fox Structures partially because of their customer service. Their follow-up and responses were above and beyond what we’ve experienced with other contractors, and they continued that throughout the whole project. They shared and respected our vision and told us what we needed to do to maintain the building’s historic integrity. The crew was very professional. I felt safe and confident that they were all professionals. Their steel work was above average, and they were super careful and respectful of the money we’d already put into the building. I would definitely recommend Fox Structures to someone else.”

When the Waldrons decided to restore an old machine shed on their family farm, they knew the job required a skilled contractor to embrace their unique vision. As supporters of local youth sports, they wanted to convert their 1950s-style shed into a practice facility for their two sons and teammates. With a sand floor and virtually no interior infrastructure, Fox Structures was careful to preserve the shed’s historic integrity.

As a farm/sport hybrid building, the Fox Structures crew were met with a variety of challenges from selecting an interior wall material that could withstand the impact of a baseball, to considering animals’ needs while working on a fully-operational farm. Additionally, the age and location of the building presented unique challenges including uneven walls/floors and major leaking/drainage issues. Fox Structures approached the job in two stages, tackling essential concrete leveling and realignment first, then construction after. Overall, every detail—lighting, colors, materials and everything in between—were skillfully and carefully considered to make this unique challenge a slam dunk! Some might even mistake this refurbished machine shed for a new structure.
