    “The whole project overall went well! It was perfect. The crew Fox Structures sent out was awesome—on time, professional and friendly. I liked that I dealt with the same foreman on all four projects. Mike is an all-around good person, very knowledgeable and was involved throughout the project from start to finish. They’re local, they stand behind what they do, and I have recommended them to others.”

When Little Chute Storage Center needed a full-service contractor for an expansion project, they selected Fox Structures based on a recommendation from a trusted source. Fox Structures built two large structures in four phases without a single setback! Intended to be leased space for businesses, these structures are much more than average storage facilities. They are heated and include exterior awnings over doors and windows to provide extra protection from the elements.
