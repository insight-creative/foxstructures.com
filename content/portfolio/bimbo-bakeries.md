When commercial property owner Jerry VanLanen wanted to build a large structure to lease to Bimbo Bakeries USA, he knew which contractor could get the project completed within his time frame. Fox Structures had successfully worked on multiple projects for Jerry in the past, including mini-warehouses and commercial spaces.

“We’ve got a longstanding relationship with Jerry—we have done a lot of projects for him over the years, and this was a new opportunity for him,” said Mark Mashlan, Fox Structures president. “Bimbo Bakeries let us know what they needed and provided us with a spec book of what the facility needed to have included for them to lease it.”

For example, the company sought plenty of dock doors for trucks that would be coming in and out to keep the bakery products moving out to big box stores and other retailers.

One of the challenges for Fox Structures was getting the project done within a tight timeline, Mark said. “There was a lot to get done in the four-month stretch, but we just put enough resources toward it and scheduled it correctly. We have a good team of subcontractors that were able to come through for us and make it all happen.”

Fox Structures, however, had its own weld shop construct the steel building to help keep the project on track. “Everyone’s so busy now that it might take six, seven or eight months to get a building. We didn't have that much time to wait, so we engineered it and built it in-house.”

Fox Structures was able to complete the project in under four months, starting in early March 2025 and completed it on July 1.
