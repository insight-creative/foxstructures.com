When commercial property owner Jerry VanLanen set out to construct a large-scale facility for Bimbo Bakeries USA, he knew exactly who to call. Having partnered with Fox Structures on multiple successful projects in the past—including mini-warehouses and commercial spaces—Jerry was confident they could deliver once again.

The new facility required numerous dock doors to support the constant flow of trucks transporting bakery products to big-box stores and retailers. Meeting this operational demand meant the building had to be completed on a very tight timeline.

Fox Structures rose to the challenge. Within four months, the team coordinated internal staff, trusted subcontractors, and critical resources to ensure the project stayed on schedule without sacrificing quality.

A key advantage was Fox Structures’ in-house weld shop, which allowed the company to engineer and fabricate the steel building themselves. By eliminating long lead times—often six to eight months—Fox Structures kept the project moving efficiently from start to finish.

Breaking ground in early March 2025, Fox Structures completed the project in under four months, delivering a high-performance facility on time and ready to support Bimbo Bakeries USA’s distribution needs.
