When Mr. Q’s Shops and Storage wanted to maximize space for their storage business, Fox Structures delivered results by helping to add a climate-controlled storage unit to their commercial property. As a construction professional himself, it was extremely important to owner Tom McHugh that this storage unit be made with the highest quality materials and building techniques. Thanks to Fox Structures, Mr. Q’s Shops and Storage is now able to provide heated, indoor storage for their customers’ RVs, trailers and motor homes.
