    “Fox Structures is good at coming up with solutions for different projects. This was out of their wheelhouse, in a way—it really doesn’t fit in any contractor’s box, because it’s not a full-blown commercial project, it’s not residential. It’s definitely a mix between the two—it’s a totally custom commercial building.”

When Tom McHugh Construction needed a new headquarters to accommodate its growth—aiming to consolidate operations in a dynamic space for its builders, real estate brokerage and design center—the company turned to Fox Structures. 

Owner Tom McHugh had worked with Fox Structures on previous projects, including storage units and shops, so he knew the builder would be a good partner on his unique project. 

“Fox Structures was flexible, kind of co-general-contracting the project with us,” Tom said. “I reached out to them and they said, ‘It’s no problem, we’ll do what you want, and we won’t do what you don’t want.” 

The project was a true joint effort: McHugh’s designer drew up the floor plan. “Then I gave it to Fox Structures so they could put their commercial codes to it.” McHugh dug the foundation for the new building. Fox Structures completed the flatwork, also erecting the shell of the building and installing the metal. McHugh then insulated the building and installed steel inside of the shops.  

“Fox Structures installed our doors and windows, which we supplied, and then we took the project back over,” McHugh says. “The big part was the design center, so the goal was to make it look more like a house than a commercial building.” 

The building was finished in early 2025 and includes offices, showroom, shop, and a warehouse. 

McHugh wanted some special custom features on the exterior, such as cedar columns, which Fox Structures incorporated. “In the back entryway, there’s a cedar-covered porch accent. Fox Structures basically roughed it all in, and then my trim carpenters built the cedar boxes that enclosed everything.” 

McHugh also wanted a shingled roof so that the building looked more like a house on the exterior side that faced busy Highway 15, continuing with a metal roof on the rest of the building. “Fox Structures came up with a solution so that it blended nicely,” McHugh said.  

“We’re all contractors, so it was pretty easy to work with each other,” he says. “Their installers are very detail-oriented, and the quality from the framers was really good—it was well done.”
