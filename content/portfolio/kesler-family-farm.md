    “Very good quality work! They were friendly and punctual—even in miserable weather! Fox Structures worked well under pressure. The farm was still operating around them while they worked. They were conscious of that and careful. Two of the guys on the job site were owners. Fox Structures really cares … you just don’t see that every day. I would definitely consider them a high-quality contractor and would recommend them. I worked with a lot of contractors and I was very pleased to work with these guys.”

After a devastating electrical fire destroyed the farm’s largest barn, the family’s spirit was not broken! Within a year, Fox Structures helped the Kesler Family rebuild a beautiful Amish-style barn to fulfill their ambitions for an even more exciting future, supporting local educational initiatives. The old-fashioned, two-story barn features a hay loft, interior office, wrap-around porch, plus plenty of space for tours and local 4-H events.
