When Clever K9s wanted to add an indoor pool to their dog daycare in Kaukauna, Fox Structures worked quickly to create a custom buildout fit for their customers’ furry companions. The project required a complete reconfiguration of Clever K9’s indoor kennel and retail area. Fox Structures tore down a wall to add more space for the kennel, opened the ceiling to the rafters, and completed the buildout with moisture-resistant materials all within 60 days. Now, Clever K9s offers dog swim services that they can conveniently and safely conduct in their new pool room!
