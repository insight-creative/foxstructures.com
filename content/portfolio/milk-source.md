    “It is worth noting that construction wasn’t taking place on an empty site, but rather a modern working farm with professionals continuing to care for a large herd of valuable animals every hour of every day. The undertaking required a careful, thoughtful and meticulous approach to the work. Milk Source is absolutely satisfied with the efforts of Fox Structures’ team. They worked alongside our crew in extreme conditions and were just as exhausted as we were by the time we resolved our core issues.”

When a once-in-a-century snowstorm swept through Wisconsin in April 2018, Fox Structures’ crew dug out of nearly 20” of snow to assist customers in a time of crisis. Milk Source, a large local dairy operation in Kaukauna, experienced two barn roofs collapsing under the weight of snow and ice. Arriving within hours of the collapse, Fox Structures worked with Milk Source and other specialists to assess the safety and stability of the barns, determine if they were salvageable, safely remove debris and prepare for an expedited rebuild. Safety for workers and the animals in a holding pen within one of the barns was top priority. Any extended delay in milking could have led the animals to undue stress, even death. Within two days a plan was in place, critical building materials were ordered, a vast majority of the cows were back on a regular milking rotation, and the farm’s infrastructure was rebuilt to be even stronger than before.
