    “We’d worked with Fox Structures before—and we were very pleased—so we knew they were the company to build a new workshop on our waterfront lot. They do what they say they’re going to do and they stand behind their work. When a few obstacles came up, they worked with us and kept at it until they got things exactly how we wanted them. They created an awesome space! It’s a really unique, cool building with a sleek, contemporary look—not at all cookie cutter. I like watching people see it for the first time … it’s not like anything they’ve seen before. Fox Structures was excellent throughout the building process. They’re just a really good company.”

Way beyond your average workshop! Troy and Gail Temme turned to Fox Structures to design, fabricate and build a multi-use workspace that’s as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Situated among upscale homes, this modern, industrial-chic masterpiece combines a hobby shop with business offices and was completed on schedule in just three months. Fox Structures’ weld shop expertly crafted the steel frame; then it was clad in T10-B wall panels supplied by Metal Sales Manufacturing that offered precisely the look the Temmes desired. Commercial grade windows and doors finished off the project and beautifully frame the stunning water views.
