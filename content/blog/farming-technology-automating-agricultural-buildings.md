## Farming technology meets innovative construction
At Fox Structures, we know that a quality agricultural building is more than a structure—it’s the foundation for your entire farming operation. To automate your farm and cut out time-sucking busy work, you’ll need agricultural buildings that work for you. That’s why our ag construction experts stay up-to-date on the latest building techniques and farming technology.

### Environ-Tech automation
This advanced farming technology allows you to fully automate the climate control of your agricultural buildings. With various sensors, this technology can monitor outside temperature, wind and rain. Using data from the sensors, Environ-Tech can then automatically adjust various components inside your ag buildings, including:

- Fans
- Sprinklers
- Lighting
- Curtains
- And more!

All of these components are essential to automate if you want to save time and resources. If we had to pick one component to automate, though, we highly recommend automating your curtain systems.

### Automatic agricultural curtain systems
Using the Environ-Tech farming technology, Fox Structures can help you automate your ag curtains. This technology can be integrated into both new ag buildings and existing farm structures.

How do these curtain systems help to automate your farm operations?

- Raises curtains in hot weather to provide ventilation
- Lowers curtains in cold weather
- Strategically blocks rain and strong winds by sensing which direction it is blowing and lowering curtains only on that side

Just think of how long it takes to raise or lower your curtains once and you’ll already see the value of automating them. With this technology, you can trust that your ag buildings are always regulated to the optimal temperature, all without the hassle.

### Agrimesh AI technology
By utilizing Agrimesh technology in your agricultural buildings, you’ll have 24/7 peace of mind. Much like Environ-Tech, Agrimesh can connect to just about any electrical component throughout various buildings. What makes this technology so integral for farmers is its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

Agrimesh uses AI technology to analyze data it gathers about current conditions, energy output and your entire system overall. It then uses that data to make smart decisions about which components to turn on and off at any given time.

That means that your livestock, indoor growing systems and more will be properly cared for within perfectly climate-controlled buildings, all while being as efficient as possible.

Plus, you’ll never have to worry about an outage due to a lost internet connection! Agrimesh uses radio wave frequencies to operate, rather than WiFi, you will still retain full barn control even if you lose internet connection.

### Custom automation integration
Already have automation technology installed in your ag buildings? Fox Structures can work with what you already have to integrate automatic curtains and more into your building.
