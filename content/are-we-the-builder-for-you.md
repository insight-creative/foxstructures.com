    What makes Fox Structures different from any other construction company in Northeast Wisconsin? It’s our focus on two things: listening to our clients to understand their vision and expectations, and most importantly, delivering what we promise. 


    In addition to our top-quality structures, we believe that the long-term relationships we build with our clients are equally important. In fact, **80% of our business** comes from repeat customers who we’ve served for decades. Working with Fox Structures means getting a dedicated construction partner for life.
