      answer: >-
        Every office building is different and can be built to your unique needs and specifications. However, there are a few common aspects that are usually included in an office building, including meeting spaces, open workspaces for cubicles or desks, executive offices, storage rooms, cafeterias or lunch rooms and more.

        The size of your office building will depend on your unique business and needs. For example, you may want a larger building if you need to include both an office space and a warehouse within your structure. You may also want to consider creating a flexible office space that provides more room than the typical cubicle workstations found in many corporate offices.
