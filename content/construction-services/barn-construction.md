    Frequently Asked Barn Construction Questions
  questions:
    - question: How much does it cost to build a barn?
      answer: >-
        The cost of building a barn varies greatly depending on your specific project specifications, timeline and more. Here at Fox Structures, we offer premier barn building services that take your unique operation and needs into account, as well as the use of high-quality materials that last, even in harsh Wisconsin weather conditions. 


        To get an accurate estimate of your barn construction costs, [contact us today](/contact/) or give us a call at <a href="tel:920-766-9305">920-766-9305</a>.
    - question: What is the cheapest type of barn to build?
      answer: >-
        Pole barns are typically cheaper to build than their steel or frame barn counterparts. However, this will of course depend on other factors such as additional materials used, the size of the barn, the amount of concrete pouring needed and additional factors. 


        Despite being a more affordable option, Fox Structures pole barns are still built with the highest quality materials and building techniques to ensure long-lasting functional and structural integrity.
    - question: What is the best material to build a barn?
      answer: >-
        You’ll need top-quality, sturdy materials to build a barn that can withstand the harsh Wisconsin weather. Steel is a commonly used material for barn walls and siding that provides protection from the weather, as well as the structural integrity needed to stay functional for years to come. 


        The designers and ag construction team here at Fox Structures can help you determine the best materials for your unique barn construction project.
    - question: What kind of flooring is best for a barn?
      answer: >-
        Concrete flooring is typically best for barn buildings, especially those used for livestock and/or storage. Concrete is not only very sturdy and can withstand a heavy amount of wear and tear, but it is also extremely easy to clean. Plus, <a href="https://clmfireproofing.com/understanding-the-fire-resistance-of-concrete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower">concrete is one of the most fire-resistant materials available for barn construction</a>. This makes it the optimal choice for most barn buildings, no matter what kind of ag operation you have.
    - question: Can Fox Structures complete the concrete pouring for my barn construction project?
      answer: >-
        Yes! Fox Structures provides full-service barn construction, including concrete work. Thanks to our merger with R&R Concrete, our team can now complete large-scale concrete projects faster and more precisely than ever.
