  questions:
    - question: How does a storage unit business work?
      answer: >-
        Self-storage businesses are becoming more and more popular in Wisconsin and throughout the nation. That’s because they require minimal upkeep and can provide a great return on investment if you follow the proper steps and invest in high-quality building materials like those offered at Fox Structures. 


        Once you have a storage unit facility built or purchased, you can rent out the units as a landlord would rent apartment space. Because [personal storage is in such high demand](/blog/storage-building-demand/), this can be a great business opportunity.

    - question: What do mini storage buildings include?
      answer: >-
        Typically, mini storage facilities try to optimize the space and fit as many storage units as possible within the building. Some mini storage warehouses include front desks, and many include security cameras both inside and outside of the building to ensure renters are safe and abiding by the rules of their contract. 


        Fox Structures can help design and construct your custom mini storage facility to your exact needs and specifications, including climate control storage units and more.
    - question: What is a good size for a mini storage facility?
      answer: >-
        There really is no minimum or maximum size you’ll need to adhere to in order to build a profitable storage facility. Many storage business owners start out with a few structures that include around 10-15 units and expand their business once they have renters for each of their existing units. 


        No matter how large or small your mini storage needs are, Fox Structures can help construct your facility and get you started with a top-quality building that will last for decades.
    - question: Can Fox Structures complete the concrete work for my mini storage facility?
