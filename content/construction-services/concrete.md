  questions:
    - question: How much do concrete services cost?
      answer: >-
        Every concrete project is unique and pricing varies greatly depending on
        your exact specifications, timeline and more. Here at Fox Structures, we
        offer premier concrete services that take your unique vision and needs
        into account, as well as the use of high-quality materials that last,
        even in harsh Wisconsin weather conditions. 


        To get an accurate estimate of your concrete work costs, [contact us
        today](/contact/) or give us a call at <a
        href="tel:920-766-9305">920-766-9305</a>.
    - question: When can I schedule concrete services?
      answer: >-
        To cure properly, it is important that concrete remains outside of
        extremely cold and/or wet conditions. Because of this, we typically
        avoid scheduling concrete work during winter months. Typically, Fox
        Structures concrete services can be scheduled from late April through
        early November, though this is subject to change due to weather
        conditions. 


        Our team can help you determine the best time to schedule your concrete
        work, as well as other construction services, to best fit your schedule
        and assure proper curing.
    - question: Is concrete a good material to use for construction?
      answer: >-
        Yes! Concrete is a widely used, cost-effective construction material
        that provides many benefits to you on any construction project. First
        and foremost, concrete is strong and durable and can hold up to a lot of
        wear and tear. It’s also fire-resistant and able to withstand harsh
        weather conditions (perfect for Wisconsin weather!). 


        Concrete is also fairly low maintenance, which makes it a great choice
        for our commercial, residential and agricultural clients alike. It’s
        easy to clean, doesn’t need to be treated and typically doesn’t have as
        many issues with rotting and insect infestation as wood or other common
        building materials.
